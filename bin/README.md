# Project 1 for Programming 2
#
#
# Personality Quiz: Silly Internet Personality Quiz
# Take this quiz to see what kind of personality type you are based on your mood, mustache, booty, and bankroll.
# Answer questions yes or no, your answers will be stored and tabulated, then your personality type will be displayed. 
# 
# 
#
# Confirmed New Class Files:
#
# added Quiz, Traits, Person, PersonalityType Classes 
#
# added GUI and fxml files for each personality type.
# Known bugs:  
# adding fxml files caused issues when switching between fxml files.  
# data controller class needed but not enough time to add. 
# unable to display personality type description from array after switching fxml file. (null pointer)
# 
# Person class creates Person and stores their email.  Future development would save Person info to file
# Personality class killed, as PersonalityType Array list functioned better than abstract Personalities
# Quiz Class expanded to create question Arrays as well as do the vast majority of calculations
# justaGUIController class will run fxml files and show GUI items
# Original Class Authors: Person - Nick Zeig; PersonalityType - Zachariah Sykes; Quiz - Stephen Torrijas; Traits - Kristy Miller;
# justaGUIController and Quiz class expanded by group to do the functions of this program

# Resources: 
# images sourced from google image search
# BroCode youtube tutorial on switching scenes with fxml was used.
